## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

MSc Graduate in Engineering Physics from Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico & EPFL.  
My interests span across **Physics**, particularly **General Relativity** and **Black Holes**, as well as **Machine Learning**. I'm also passionate about **sports**, including **tennis**, **basketball**, and **football** (soccer). 

In my recent work, I applied **Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)** to the field of Black Hole Physics, computing the **Quasibound states** of the **curved spacetime Klein-Gordon equation**.

Iâ€™m open to collaboration in any of these areas, whether it be academic or technical.
