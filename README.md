## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

MSc Graduate in Engineering Physics from [Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en/) and [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/).
My interests span across **Physics**, particularly **General Relativity** and **Black Holes**, as well as **Machine Learning**. I'm also passionate about **sports**, including **tennis**, **basketball**, and **football** (soccer). 

In my recent work, I applied **Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)** to the field of Black Hole Physics, computing the **Quasibound states** of the **curved spacetime Klein-Gordon equation**. This work was done within [Gr@v](http://gravitation.web.ua.pt/) and [centra](https://centra.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/).

Excited to apply my statistical and programming knowledge to tackle a variety of complex problems.

Iâ€™m open to collaboration in any of these areas, whether it be academic or technical.
